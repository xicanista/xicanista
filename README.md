# 👋 Hi, I'm Erica Rios (@xicanista)

I'm an entrepreneurial product builder passionate about helping companies translate bold ideas into technically sound, user-centered products.

After leading product growth across marketplaces, ecommerce, and consumer tech, I'm now pivoting closer to technical execution — building with Python, APIs, databases, and real-time data systems — because I want to help create the future, not just define it.

## 🚀 Current Projects
- [NWSL-LFG](https://github.com/xicanista/NWSL-LFG) — A fan engagement platform for the National Women’s Soccer League, combining real-time behavioral analytics, recommendation systems, and generative AI.

I'm particularly excited about applying AI and data-driven techniques — such as personalization, recommendation engines, and real-time analytics — to build the next generation of intelligent, user-centered products.
